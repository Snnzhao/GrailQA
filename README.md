# GrailQA

Strongly **G**ene**ra**l**i**zab**l**e Question Answering Dataset (GrailQA) is a new large-scale, high-quality KBQA dataset with 64,331 questions annotated with both answers and corresponding logical forms in different syntax (i.e., SPARQL, S-expression, etc.). It can be used to test three levels of generalization in KBQA: i.i.d., compositional, and zero-shot.

All datasets and resources can be found on the homepage of GrailQA: https://dki-lab.github.io/GrailQA/

Note that, current results of our own models on the leaderboard are not accurate as we just made several updates on our dataset. We will update all the numbers on the leaderboard (also the numbers on our paper) as soon as possible.
